Overview of Organizational Attrition Analysis in Power BI

Using Power BI, this project conducted a structured analysis of organizational attrition, covering essential steps in data processing, transformation, and visualization to highlight key attrition trends.

Key Phases and Findings

Data Processing and Transformation:
Initial steps included cleaning raw CSV data to remove redundant columns and standardize data types. New fields, such as AttritionRate, AgeGroup, and SalarySlab, were created to improve clarity and facilitate targeted analysis.

Visualization and Insights:
A comprehensive dashboard was built to present key attrition metrics, including attrition count and rate, average age, and salary. Detailed visual breakdowns showcased patterns across age, salary, job role, and tenure, revealing that:

Attrition rates were notably higher among men, especially within the 26-35 age group and for salaries around or below 5k.
Departments like Laboratory Technician and Sales Executive had increased attrition, linked to more critical feedback.
Analysis showed retention challenges at 1-5 years and around 10 years of tenure.
Recommendations for Improvement:

Re-evaluate compensation for employees with lower salary ranges.
Address high attrition in specific departments with targeted interventions.
Enhance retention strategies for new employees to improve long-term engagement.

Conclusion:
This analysis highlighted essential insights into attrition trends, guiding focused improvements in compensation, departmental strategies, and employee retention efforts to build a stable and engaged workforce.
